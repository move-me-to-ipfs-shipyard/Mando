peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i'm qested with delivering Grogu to peer-to-peer Jedi like Jesus is quested with turning water into wine

:stormtroopers
we money-services-outnumber you 6 to 1
:_
i like those guests-p2p-odds

:_
peer-to-peer programs are few, like Greef Karga's bounty pucks
more pucks are needed - not just lonely torrent clients
:Karga
Mando, enjoy your rewards - buy a camtono of experimental-server-browser spice
by the mite you come out of hyperdrive, you would've forgotten all about it

Armorer tasked me with being peer-to-peer Github
  it's a big mission like Pat Brown and Impossible Foods have
  but i will bring it in warm
  climb with passion like Alex Honnold on El Sendero Luminosa
i will take best from
  Github - simple, sapcious ui, repos without gitlab projects complexity, open without login
  Conquiztador - play question-challenge-course game
  Heroes of Might and Magic III - play tile-map game
  Tor - circuit relay
  browsers - links tabs history
  torrent
    discover and keep fresh list of peers myself - no hypocritical find-ids-on-some-forum
    like Cypher i appreciate the Matrix of DHT
minus
  the disease of money-donate-sponsors-ads-jobs-coins-fundings-bounties
  issues-discussions-scratching on top of our heads
  caging programs under user namepsaces 
    making L3-39 furios - why?! because you're my organic overlord?!
  turning programs into projects 
    like when producers push Nick Lang to play Joe Gunn when he wants Ray Casanov part
  Starlord's smiley corporate dad Ego who spread himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will have every game be multiplayer and use programming language as gameplay
i will myself highly replicate and distirbute data among peers
  so user only says - i allocate this much space for Mando
  can always be 0 - i will have barriers-ratios-limits
  anyone can use me in my entirety without giving back
i will have users and indetity - i will take back DIDs-Fett-armor from lazy-settled Cobb Vanth
i will be desktop - as that needs clarifying when one takes program-a-program puck
i will not be mobile - user only needs one light droid - a laptop
  they can hold on their hand and arm 
  and put on the table and use whole keyboard, not a screen young-Forrest-Gump-grease finger ghost 
i will be entirely free
  no money-ads-coins-jobs-sponsors-donations-bounties-fundings lethal corrosion
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning guests' Isengard Tower and garden into money's orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin fuel

i'm not gonna trade anything - these guests-parts are mine - they money-stole it from me!

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition while staying focused on quest
  dont want to found another guild or Blac Saber to rule Mandalore
  too many guilds not enough programs
i need a repository named Mando - like Commander Data i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Mando
      email = Mando@Brown-Eyes
    
    # git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  add src/Mando/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path ../.gitconfig
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues projects wiki discussions tabs
i will freely choose one network and libraries i will use
  simple as Game Changers - i choose plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of beskar parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Kuiil with it
  he loves his craft, serves no one and has IG-11 with him
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as whole program like Groot
my first puck will be - users can create and explore repositories

i need Kuiil to stay guest at a house - like when Talahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
  he only needs a couch to crash - comes late leaves early
  Kuiil spends his day in a public library or sport-esport event
i need him to choose and assemble himself Lothlorien vegan meal for the day
  so he endures like Rich Roll, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  Kuiil needs no cooking - he applies Baloo-skills and magic microwave-potato-touch 
  to asemble complete dishes on the move
  like Hela says in Thor Ragnarok - darling, you have no idea what's possible
  cooked whole grains and legumes there are - dishes are missing
Kuiil will from time to time but consistently release Mandalorian-Theme dish to house table
  even if table moves like Merlin's Higitus-Figitus
  (raisins walnuts mango salt sweet-potatoes buckwheat black-beans)
Kuiil needs no money and has no money
  i need him to travel light like Jesus - he is accompanied only by droids
  BB-8 latop L3 phone and Honnold to protect them from explosions like Groot
he is now in a public library near here https://goo.gl/maps/GGmem4esezKno7RY8
  Kuiil is yet to find out where he's staying tonight
  he is ready now to take Buckbeak or Hogwarts Express and drop by as guest like Emilien to Daniel
  to continue free-willingly helping me to return the kid to his kind
  like that time when Grogu and i were pinned down by the guild - we need Madalorian friends to invite us

this is the way
